# limit_switch
A simple and compact way to add motion limits to a mechanism. It uses a small magnet and a hall-effect switch IC mounted on a small PCB.
It was designed in particular for the Openflexure_Microscope project, and the file limit_Switches.odt describes how the first implementation was done. (https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope).
